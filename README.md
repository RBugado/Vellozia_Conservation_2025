Abstract:

Conservation is an important subject today, most notably due to climate change and habitat loss, which cause many species to be at risk for extinction. Therefore, it is extremely relevant to work on conserving as many at-risk ecosystems and species as possible. One relevant ecosystem is the campo rupestre, found in central eastern Brazil, mostly in the Espinhaço mountain range. It is within the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest bioregions, which are hotspots for biodiversity. Within the campo rupestre, the plant genus Vellozia, with 127 species, is one of the most rich and abundant genera in the region. This makes the genus ecologically critical for the campo rupestre. However, despite Vellozia’s abundance and importance in the region, only 18 species have been assessed for extinction risk, and all but one of those assessed is endangered or critically endangered. We will create species distribution models for Vellozia to assess the current and future distribution under climate change, and perform preliminary extinction risk assessments. The occurrence data for Vellozia species will be gathered from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Species distribution modeling will be performed using the Maxent program. We will perform preliminary extinction risk assessments using the R package ConR. Ideally, this research will not only contribute to the conservation of Vellozia and the campo rupestre, but also inspire researchers to examine other species that have been overlooked or ignored in the past.
